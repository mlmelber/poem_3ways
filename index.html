            <div class="stanza_1">
                <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, </p>
                <p>And sorry I could not travel both </p>
                <p>And be one traveler, long I stood </p>
                <p>And looked down one as far as I could </p>
                <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth; </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza_2">
                <p>Then took the other, as just as fair, </p>
                <p>And having perhaps the better claim, </p>
                <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear; </p>
                <p>Though as for that the passing there </p>
                <p>Had worn them really about the same, </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza_3">
                <p>And both that morning equally lay </p>
                <p>In leaves no step had trodden black. </p>
                <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day! </p>
                <p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way, </p>
                <p>I doubted if I should ever come back. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza_4">
                <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh </p>
                <p>Somewhere ages and ages hence: </p>
                <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” </p>
                <p>I took the one less traveled by, </p>
                <p>And that has made all the difference. </p>
